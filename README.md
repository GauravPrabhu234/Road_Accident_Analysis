# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data, visualized through an interactive dashboard. The primary goal is to identify patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to road accidents to derive actionable insights for improving road safety.


## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of road accident data, focusing on casualties. It features a range of visualizations and KPIs:

  * **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** At-a-glance metrics including **Total No of Casualties**, breakdowns by **Severity** (Fatal, Serious, Slight), and **Total Casualties by Car**.

  * **Visualizations:**

      * **Total Casualties by Vehicle:** A breakdown of casualties caused by different vehicle types (Car, Bus, Motorcycle, etc.).
      * **CY VS PY Casualties Monthly Trend:** A line chart comparing casualties on a monthly basis between the current year (2021) and the previous year (2020).
      * **Area-wise Casualties:** A donut chart showing the distribution of casualties between **Rural** and **Urban** areas.
      * **Casualties by Road Type:** A bar chart illustrating the number of casualties on different road types like Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, etc.
      * **Casualties by Light Condition:** A donut chart comparing accidents that occurred in **Daylight** versus **Darkness**.
      * **Casualties by Road Surface:** A treemap displaying the impact of road surface conditions like **Dry**, **Wet**, and **Snow**.

  * **Interactive Filters:** The dashboard includes a filter panel to dynamically slice the data by **Accident Date**, **Year**, **Wind Conditions**, and **Weather Conditions**.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

Based on the dashboard, several key insights can be drawn:

  * **Severity:** The vast majority of casualties (**83.5%**) are of **Slight Severity**.
  * **Vehicle Impact:** Cars are the most significant contributor to casualties, accounting for **78.5%** of the total.
  * **Location:** **Urban** areas witness a significantly higher number of casualties compared to Rural areas.
  * **Light & Road Conditions:** A majority of accidents occur during **Daylight** (72%) and on **Dry** road surfaces, suggesting that adverse conditions are not the primary cause in most cases.
  * **Temporal Trends:** The monthly trend for casualties remained relatively consistent between 2020 and 2021, with no drastic seasonal spikes.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

To explore the data, simply use the **Filter Panel** on the right side of the dashboard:

1.  **Select a Year:** Click on a year (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022) to view data for that specific period.
2.  **Filter by Conditions:** Use the dropdowns for **Wind Conditions** and buttons for **Weather Conditions** to narrow down the analysis to specific environmental factors.
3.  All charts and KPIs on the dashboard will automatically update to reflect your selections.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

  * **Geospatial Analysis:** Incorporate a map visualization to identify accident hotspots.
  * **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of accidents based on weather, time, and location.
  * **Deeper Drill-Down:** Add more granular data, such as time of day, day of the week, and driver age demographics, for a more detailed analysis.
  * **Real-time Data:** Integrate a real-time data feed to monitor accidents as they happen.
